# SlienceG Team Solution for KDDCUP2022
for each turbine, we have 3 models:<br>
1 for lightgbm(namely lgn)<br>
1 for first 144 timestamps prediction(namely GRU-FH)<br>
1 for 288 timestamps prediction(namely GRU-ALL).<br>

## model training:
**before training, you need to upload the dataset into folder LGB_train and GRU_train.**<br>
### for LGB_train:  
 1. modify the file prepare.py to your path.<br>
 2. data proprecess
 ```Bash
 python datapreprocess.py #Bash
 ```
 3. LGB Train
 ```Bash
 python train_split_smooth.py #Bash
 ```
### for GRU_train:
1. modify the file prepare.py to your path.<br>
2. if you want to train GRU-ALL, set the output_len 288,<br>
   elif you want to train GRU-FH, set the output_len 144.<br>
3. model training
```Bash
python train.py #Bash
```
## model testing:
**before testing, put the pretrained model into folder checkpoints of prediction**<br>
1. modify the file prepare.py and predict.py to your own model path.<br>
2. submit the prediction folder for online test.<br>
